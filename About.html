    <h1> This is a project for course CPSC 455</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 35px">The idea is based on the video game League of Legend: Teamfight Tactics, which is a round-based strategy game.
        In the game, in order to defeat opponents, players need to buy different champions and deploy multiple champions with shared traits to unlock combat bonuses.
        Here I made each champions as a 'card'.
